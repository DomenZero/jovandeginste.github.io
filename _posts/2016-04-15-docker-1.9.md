For some reason, Docker 1.9.1 no longer creates a chain in iptables; we 
used this to have dynamic port forwardings for a docker image with 
unpredictable ports (RabbitMQ). Because of the upgrade, we could no 
longer inject te dynamic ports into the chains, and the nodes no longer 
could discover the other members. 

Fixed by reverting docker to 1.8.2 (including docker-compose).
